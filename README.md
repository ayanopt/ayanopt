### Hi, I'm Ayan and I enjoy Math and Trading
I've been forward-testing statistical arbitrage trading techniques. The repo is private as a lot of it has information that I don't want shared. However, there is a lot code I want to slowly roll out for people to see regarding its infrastructure. I have some cool optimizations that people can replicate, and also borrow the infrastructure if they want to trade themselves. It's currently written in C++, Python and R, and I use bash to run/schedule commands from an EC2 instance. I love Python but I want to move to a C++/Rust architecture to improve performance. I thought this would be a good medium to share my findings and keep myself accountable

Here are the results so far
