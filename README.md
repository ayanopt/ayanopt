### Hi, I'm Ayan and I enjoy Math and Trading
I've been forward-testing statistical arbitrage trading techniques. The repo is private as a lot of it has information that I don't want shared. However, there is a lot code I want to slowly roll out for people to see regarding its infrastructure. I have some cool optimizations that people can replicate, and also borrow the infrastructure if they want to trade themselves. It's currently written in C++, Python and R, and I use bash to run/schedule commands from an EC2 instance. I love Python but I want to move to a C++/Rust architecture to improve performance. I thought this would be a good medium to share my findings and keep myself accountable
The results are updated every weekday by crontab scheduling on EC2.
Here are the results so far, note that some may not perform well because I am still in the process of testing.
